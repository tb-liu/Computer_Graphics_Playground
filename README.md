# Playground
Where I learn Vulkan and play around with it. Currently I am trying to make a SPH compute on GPU.

You need to have CMake, Vulkan, and SDL2 installed to run this project. 

Cmake https://cmake.org/
Vulkan SDK https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home
SDL2 https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.5

Your device needs to support Vulkan compute shader.
